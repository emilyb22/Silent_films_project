            The popularization of silent film can be traced back to the early years of the 20th century, where in America, commercial recreation was beginning to advance. It was a time where society was shifting and citizens no longer wanted to create entertainment for themselves, they wanted to buy it. In big cities, rural communities, mining camps or small towns, there was no greater attraction than going to the movies and by 1919, 26 million Americans, about 30% of the population were going to the movies every week. With no surprise in just ten years it was half the population, 50 million americans gathered in one of the 15000 theatres, 22000 churches, halls or schools that were screening movies everyday. </p>

                    The beginning of silent film can be traced back to Thomas Edison’s invention of the Kinetoscope, a machine that projected moving images into film. Originally Edison did not create this technology for public use, mainly due to economic reasoning. He wanted the Kinetoscope to be used in homes because if the machine was projecting films in theatres for large audiences it would reduce the number of devices he sold. However, society changed and film was shifting from a technology based industry to the field of entertainment. The projection of film became more desirable as it was extremely mobile and accessible to screen to a wide audience. The film industry grew as the invention of new projection systems emerged, and eventually Edison came to realize that the Kinetoscope business was coming to an end. At this point he agreed to collaborate with distributors Norman Charles Raff and Frank R. Gammon. Together they created the Vitascope, a machine that allowed film to be spliced end to end in a continuous loop so it could be shown continuously. The invention grew in its success as it produced extremely life like images and movements. The first movies were a series of short stories that lasted about 20 to 30 minutes, and the pictures were said to have been showed through the projection of the Vitascope on a drop curtain where a large picture frame was painted in the centre.
