            Going to the movies in the silent film era was considered an escape from daily life. Local theatres were used as social spaces for meeting friends, discussing gossip or political views. Every town or community had a different kind of theatre shaped to fit their citizens, whether it was based on class, race, ethnicity or gender.

            Theatre exhibitors were eager to build a regular clientele based on the kind of people gathering in their ‘neighbourhood houses’. Not everyone loved the movies however, conservative civil leaders were concerned that the topics being discussed or the oppositional stories being shown in these theatres might encourage working class people to take part in rebellious movements. They believed this mix of politics and pleasure was dangerous and it needed to stop.

            Originally, theatres were more commonly found in areas where the working class citizens lived, and where the ‘respectable’ society would never step foot. This was because transgressive and inappropriate behaviour was often associated with going to the theatres. The working class used these spaces as a vehicle to express their public identity, it was an exhilarating experience where anything could happen, there was excitement, adventure, drama, and romance. The theatres gave their lives new meaning, and it allowed them to forget their problems after a long week of hard work.
